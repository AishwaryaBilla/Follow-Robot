FOLLOWING ROBOT 

COMPONENTS we use are 
A Arduino UNO, three IR Sensors (one on the back and two in the front - left and right), one Ultrasonic Sensor, Motors, a Castor Wheel and 2 wheels , a Metal Chasis, 2 9v batteries

PROCEDURE
1) According to the program typed in arduino ide the bot moves front if the man is moving forward ans both the IR sensors get the input also the bot maintains a distance of 5 cm and stops if the distance is closer than that.
2) If the man moves left then the right wheel is given the movement so the bot takes a sharp turn instead of a long one 
3) Again the bot moves right by only moving the left wheel and keeping the right stationary, all this is done by using the IR sensors by sensing the direction as well as keeping a minimum distance of 5cm from the man
4) The bot moves in reverse direction when the back sensor is sensing movement at the back 
5) all together the whole bot is stopped when the man stops as the volage is cut off from the motors which turns the wheels of the bot .
